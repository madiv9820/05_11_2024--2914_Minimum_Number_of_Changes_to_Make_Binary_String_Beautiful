- ## Approach 2:- Consecutive Characters Comparison (Greedy)

    - ### Intuition
        The goal of this problem is to count how many changes are needed to make the string conform to a specific pattern. The pattern requires characters at even indices to match the characters at the next odd indices (i.e., characters at positions `0, 2, 4, ...` should match those at positions `1, 3, 5, ...`). 

        To solve this, we traverse the string in steps of 2 and compare adjacent characters (pairs). Whenever we find a mismatch, we count it as a change needed to make the string valid according to the pattern.

    - ### Approach

        1. **Initialize a Counter:**
            - We initialize a variable `total_InterChanges` to 0, which will count how many changes are required.

        2. **Iterate Through the String in Steps of 2:**
            - We loop through the string with a step size of 2, comparing characters at positions `0` and `1`, `2` and `3`, `4` and `5`, and so on.
            - For each pair of characters at indices `(index, index + 1)`, if they are not equal, it means an interchange (change) is needed to make them match.

        3. **Count the Changes:**
            - Whenever a mismatch is found between the characters at `index` and `index + 1`, increment the `total_InterChanges` counter.

        4. **Return the Total Number of Changes:**
            - After the loop finishes, return the `total_InterChanges` which represents the total number of changes required to make the string valid.

    - ### Time Complexity

        - **Time Complexity: O(n)**  
            - We loop through the string once with a step size of 2. Each operation inside the loop (comparing two characters and potentially updating the counter) takes constant time. Since we process `n` characters and each comparison happens in constant time, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

    - ### Space Complexity

        - **Space Complexity: O(1)**
            - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. We only need a few integer variables (`total_InterChanges`, `index`) and don't use any additional data structures like arrays or hashmaps. Thus, the space complexity is __O(1)__.

        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
                class Solution:
                    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
                        # Initialize a counter to keep track of the required number of changes
                        total_InterChanges = 0
                        
                        # Iterate over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0
                        # This ensures that we compare pairs of characters at indices (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), etc.
                        for index in range(0, len(s) - 1, 2):
                            # Compare the characters at positions index and index + 1
                            if s[index] != s[index + 1]:
                                # If the characters do not match, increment the change counter
                                total_InterChanges += 1

                        # Return the total number of interchanges (changes required)
                        return total_InterChanges
            ```
        - **C++ Solution**
            ```C++ []
            class Solution {
                public:
                    int minChanges(string s) {
                        // Initialize a counter to keep track of the required number of changes
                        int total_InterChanges = 0;
                        
                        // Iterate over the string, checking pairs of characters at indices (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), etc.
                        // The loop runs with a step of 2, comparing characters at even and odd indices
                        for (int index = 0; index < s.length() - 1; index += 2) {
                            // Compare the characters at the current pair of indices
                            if (s[index] != s[index + 1]) {
                                // If the characters do not match, increment the change counter
                                ++total_InterChanges;
                            }
                        }
                        
                        // Return the total number of interchanges (changes required)
                        return total_InterChanges;
                    }
            };
            ```
